      Everyone loves to read right? Some people buy e-books to it. So, I think
      many fans of Japanese culture, in particular, anime and manga, wondered:
      why not read manga on an e-book? And indeed... The manga is mostly done in
      black and white. Personally, when I wanted to download the manga, I did
      not find a single site from where it can be downloaded - everywhere there
      is only online viewing. So, I wrote a manga parser that downloads manga
      from the site in image formats, so that later it can be transferred to an
      e-book and read offline.<br /><br />

        If you know websites with online view mode from where you cannot
        download manga please
